# sfgf
Simple and Fast Game Framework. Based on… yes, SFML!

## motivation
I really wanted to have some more complex game–related API on top on SFML, couldn't find anything on internet and… well, what could I do excluding writing it myself?

## Aim
- Rather high level, no need to understand OpenGL.
- Polygon–based collision detection.
- Children–Parent node chierarchy.
- Some set of basic classes.
- Easly extendible.
- Header–only.

## Collaboration
I'm open to proposals, if you want to add something from yourself post a feature request in 'Issues' tab or e–mail me (koczurekk@gmail.com).

## documentation
Right… [here](https://koczurekk.github.io/sfgf/)!
